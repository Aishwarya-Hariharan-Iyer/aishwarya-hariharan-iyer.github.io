  description: "As a poet and programmer, I love searching for stories hidden in the world around us—data waiting to be understood. I am particularly passionate about the use of AI technologies, whether ML, NLP, CV, or DL, to solve problem statements that transcend disciplines. As someone who is also experienced in web development and software engineering, I find great joy in transforming these solutions into tangible products that can help people around the world. Whether you want to collaborate on an exciting new idea or want to converse over a cup of coffee on your favorite poem by Neruda, drop me an email!",
